## 🚀 Getting Started

VOID is tightly integrated with `opendev-labs.github.io` and serves as the management layer for all ecosystem products.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendev-labs/void.git
cd void
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Start the intelligent management engine
npm run dev

# Launch the desktop orchestration interface (Electron)
npm run electron:dev
```

## 🏗 Architecture

VOID follows a modern micro-kernel inspired architecture to ensure 100% uptime for your critical deployments.

1. **Dashboard (React)**: High-fidelity user interface for intent-driven orchestration.
2. **Void API (Express)**: The core logic layer for deployment routing and state management.
3. **Intelligence Layer (Google Gemini)**: Automated code analysis and deployment optimization.
4. **State Engine (LamaDB)**: Distributed synchronization of deployment metadata.
